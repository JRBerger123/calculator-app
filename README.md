## Calculator App

This Java-based Calculator App is a console application designed to allow users to do calculations of basic and advanced types. This project serves as practice for using Java classes while emphasizing:
- Abstraction
- Interfaces
- Generics
- Enums

Administrators can:
- Select a calculator with basic or advanced features
- Do basic operations (+,-,x,/)
- Do advanced operations (^, sqrt)
- Manage and store a memory variable

1. Run the application from your terminal or IDE.
2. Choose whether to use basic or advanced calculator features.
3. Enter an operation when prompted:
    
    - **Basic Mode**
        - `add` or `+` ‚Äî Add numbers  
        - `subtract` or `-` ‚Äî Subtract numbers  
        - `multiply` or `*` ‚Äî Multiply numbers  
        - `divide` or `/` ‚Äî Divide numbers  

    - **Advanced Mode**
        - `sqrt` ‚Äî Square root  
        - `pow` ‚Äî Raise to a power  
        - `mem` ‚Äî Access memory options  
4. (Advanced Mode) Set the desired decimal precision for output.
5. For memory operations, choose from:
    
    - Set Memory Value
